# Vektor Flow public site

Only the reviewed0.7.2 compiler is published. `public/current-compiler-release.json`
pins the module, WASM and data hashes. The reviewed release was restored from
feb5150 after later preview publication inadvertently restored0.7.1 content.
The GPU math typing preview includes modular LaTeX documents and the full PDF
spatial accuracy report and 1–64x distance-field zoom from source9b44ef8;
full-document acceptance remains failing. Phone editor/preview controls use
source bb60444; Render collapses controls and fits content width on phones.
Document cameras support pinch/wheel zoom and direct touch/mouse dragging.
Rule shader ccaeb08 keeps radical/fraction/table edges sharp under zoom; the
comparison report retains its original pre-correction captures and pixel scores.

Legacy0.4.7 pages, runtimes and downloads,0.6 previews and superseded0.7.1
packages are retired from the deployment tree. Git history retains them; do not
copy them back into public assets. Old URLs return404 using a noindex error page.
The sitemap contains current pages only. Existing search-engine caches can take
time to disappear after recrawling; removing files does not instantly erase them.

Before publication run `python3 scripts/verify-current-site.py`, update reviewed
hashes with `python3 scripts/update-manifest.py`, and review the full asset diff.
CI checks both current-release policy and all manifest bytes before Pages deploys.
For browser verification, serve public on localhost8857 and run
`VKF_PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE=/path/to/playwright/index.mjs node tests/site-browser.mjs`.
Set VKF_SITE_URL for hosted checks. The local test uses software rendering and
makes no physical GPU performance claim. Do not reset or bypass GPU stop markers.

The existing GPU math typing transitions use CPU glyph matching/interpolation
and crossfades; they are not a GPU morphology solver or performance benchmark.
