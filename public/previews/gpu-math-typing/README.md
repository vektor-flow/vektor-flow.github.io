# Live typing test

The GitHub Pages preview at `/previews/gpu-math-typing/` is linked from Coming soon.
It renders the current source on a WebGPU canvas. Missing script/fraction operands
become empty outlined placeholders; unfinished groups, environments and nested
left/right scopes are closed for preview only. Source remains untouched and deleted
operands never come from a previous valid formula. Unknown commands show a placeholder.

Inline and Display controls choose real TeX text/display math styles: operator size,
side versus stacked limits, fractions and script placement change accordingly.
Explicit style commands and limits/nolimits override the defaults. All lowercase
and uppercase Greek are available, including upright aliases for capitals normally
written with Latin letter commands in TeX. Regular Sigma/Pi differ from sum/prod.
Contour integrals come from the development-only esint package.

Matrices and column vectors support matrix, pmatrix, bmatrix, Bmatrix, vmatrix,
Vmatrix, smallmatrix, cases, aligned, align, gathered and basic clr array alignment.
Nested fractions, scripts, power towers, angle/floor/ceiling brackets, explicit
big/Big/bigg/Bigg and nested left/right are supported. Very tall delimiters extend
font-derived stems; those extensions are a visual approximation of TeX recipes.
Standard accents include hat/widehat, tilde/widetilde, bar, vec, dot/ddot,
acute, grave, breve, check and mathring. Overline/underline span their arguments;
fixed font brace pieces and connecting rules support nested overbrace/underbrace
with labels. Overset/underset/stackrel preserve the underlying relation class.
Arrow families include long, hooked, diagonal and harpoon glyphs; over/under
left/right/bidirectional arrows and xrightarrow/xleftarrow with optional lower
labels use font-derived heads and continuous shafts. Triple/quad dots use an
independent dot arrangement; exact AMS placement of those two accents is unverified.
Arrow fixtures verify outer ink envelopes and label positions, not shaft interiors.

Common siunitx syntax supports qty/unit, legacy SI/si, num and ang, upright SI
base/derived units, prefixes, per, squared/cubed/tothe/raiseto, decimal/scientific
numbers, digit grouping, angles and literal unit abbreviations such as m/s.
Options: per-mode=power/symbol/fraction, group-digits and output-decimal-marker.
Unknown options/units produce draft diagnostics. Rounding, uncertainty notation,
locale profiles, lists/ranges, custom unit declarations and the full siunitx
option surface are not implemented. units.mjs is independent of the package.
The development oracle uses unmodified siunitx 3.6.4 (2026-10-12).

Array rules/options, optional row spacing, arbitrary packages/macros, radicals,
general document layout and full TeX compatibility are not implemented.

Real LaTeX is used only during development. The browser loads 1,411 mapped symbols
in display/text/script/scriptscript styles (5,644 keys, 3,315 distinct outlines),
using a 4096×8192 MTSDF atlas and one batched draw per edit. No LaTeX, KaTeX,
font loading, DOM math or Canvas2D text runtime is used. Native VKF compiler
integration is pending. Source is never evaluated as JavaScript or inserted as HTML.

Input-to-GPU timing measures handler entry through layout, upload and completed
queue submission. The next animation frame is an estimate, not physical screen
presentation. Cold download and pipeline preparation are reported separately.
The p95 window covers 120 updates; 10 ms is a target, not a guarantee.
Budgets: 12,000 source characters, 3,000 atoms, 32 nested levels, 32 columns,
100 matrix rows, 12,000 draw instances and 2,500 CSS pixels of canvas height.
Extra-wide grouped atoms and taller output may clip.

Reproduce by running map_symbols.py --extended --style STYLE --oracle-extras DIR
for the four styles into fresh typing-STYLE directories. DIR contains the unmodified
esint LaTeX/Type1 oracle files. Run prepare_typing.py --oracle-extras DIR; copy the
atlas and typing-data.json here, and copy typing-layout.mjs draft-parser.mjs and units.mjs
from the parent directory. Serve through HTTPS/localhost. verify_extended_layout.py
checks fresh native LaTeX ink bounds and fraction rules in either mode. Node tests
cover draft recovery and deletion; verify_typing_browser.mjs drives real textarea
input, style changes, feature examples and canvas output using headed SwiftShader.
Physical GPU stop remains unchanged.

MIT applies to runtime source. Font-derived atlas data retains applicable AMS/SIL
OFL and esint/LPPL notices; MSDFgen also has its own notice. EC/TC glyphs have separate notices and their complete unmodified source archive. esint-source archives
provide the unmodified upstream sources. esint symbols are mapped to a differently
named combined atlas and are never installed as modified esint font files.

For this extension, --reuse DIR reuses earlier oracle glyph folders without
changing them; add siunitx.sty and its translation dependency to the development
oracle directory. Font skew, advance and accent-font x-height are extracted from
actual TFM/DVI data. Include the unmodified siunitx and EC source archives and
notices when distributing these prepared assets. Common geometry is checked
against fresh LaTeX independently; browser tests also drive partially typed accents,
arrows and quantities. All recorded browser evidence uses software SwiftShader.

## Page flow and appearance

In Math input, a top-level `\\` or `\newline` starts a new left-aligned row.
Matrix/environment row separators retain their existing meaning. This bare-math
linebreak is a preview extension; standard LaTeX uses a multiline environment.
Row spacing follows struts and the actual height/depth, so tall fractions and
scripts do not collide. General equation alignment uses the existing aligned
or array support; automatic wrapping of grouped math remains bounded.

Text + math input uses the same Computer Modern Roman family and measured
native advances, kerning, ligatures, punctuation and common Latin accents.
Embed math with $…$ / $$…$$ or \(…\) / \[…\]. Blank lines create paragraphs;
\\ creates a hard break. Prose uses independent greedy word flow; it does not
implement TeX paragraph optimization, justification or automatic hyphenation.
Long words can split between glyphs. Source text is never inserted as HTML.

Page-width and text-size sliders reflow or scale the canvas. The colour swatches
and picker change default ink; explicit source colours stay assigned to their
own glyphs. Opacity affects both default and explicit ink so blending is visible.
All glyphs/rules carry their colours in the GPU instance packet, with premultiplied
alpha. Colour-only edits reuse cached layout and submit a new instance draw.
Named \color and \textcolor, HTML/RGB/rgb values and nested colour scopes are
supported in math. The Colour example includes several source colours.

Native math alphabet families include mathrm, mathbf, mathit, mathsf, mathtt,
mathnormal, mathfrak, mathcal, mathscr, mathbb and boldsymbol (bm alias). All
families have display/text/script/scriptscript mappings. Calligraphic and RSFS
script use their native capital alphabets; missing lowercase is a diagnostic,
not a different glyph from that font slot. AMS mathbb capitals retain their
standard appearance; lowercase/digits use a documented BBOLD extension, with
mathbbold selecting BBOLD for the whole Latin/digit alphabet. This extension
is checked against the native BBOLD LaTeX alphabet, not unsupported AMS slots.
The regular Roman/bold/italic/sans/monospace/normal faces also map Greek capitals;
boldsymbol handles the mapped Greek and ordinary symbols. Full arbitrary font
package selection and every possible alphabet/glyph combination remain outside scope.

Prepared assets include new AMS/Euler notices and the unmodified RSFS/BBOLD source
archives. The GPL mathrsfs adapter is used only by the development oracle; its
source and GPLv2 text are supplied separately. It does not execute in the browser.


## Modular LaTeX rendering on 2026-10-15

The math preview adds roots, binomials/generalized fractions, notation/box helpers,
native extension pieces, formatted text, equation/align variants and array rules.
The independent document preview is document.html; its class/package modules live
in latex-modules/. A4 article flow, basic h figures, local GPU image textures and
simple references are experimental. Full-document pixel acceptance is failing.
See document-checks/ for original sources, reference PDFs, GPU pages, differences
and separately measured timings. This is not a release of the VKF compiler.

Source checkpoint: eefd317 in vektor-flow/vektor-flow, branch codex/gpu-math-20261014.
The report covers all46 reference pages; the independent renderer produces45.
